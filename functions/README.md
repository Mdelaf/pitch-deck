# Pitch Deck Serverless Functions

In this project we store all serverless functions used for the Pitch Deck web platform.


## Local setup

Assuming you have Node and NPM installed, follow these steps:

1. Install serverless globally:
```
npm i -g serverless
```

2. Install project dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Run the project locally
```
serverless offline
```

Now you can test your functions using the endpoints exposed by the previous command.
